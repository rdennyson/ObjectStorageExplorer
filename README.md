# Oracle Object Storage Management Application

This application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for securely interacting with Oracle Object Storage using the `OCI.DotNetSDK.Objectstorage` library. It enables users to upload, download, and manage data stored in Oracle's cloud, making it ideal for businesses, developers, and IT teams handling cloud-based file storage.

## Features

- **Secure Connection to Oracle Object Storage**: Connect to Oracle Object Storage using credentials from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).
- **File Management**: Upload, download, and manage files within your Oracle Object Storage buckets.
- **Configuration Management**: Save and reuse connection settings, allowing frequent access to cloud storage without re-entering credentials.
- **Optional Gateway Configuration**: Customize connection endpoints via Gateway URL for specific network requirements.

## Requirements

This application requires the following OCI details to connect with Oracle Object Storage:

- `TenantId`: OCI tenancy ID.
- `UserId`: Unique user ID within the tenancy.
- `Fingerprint`: Fingerprint for the user’s public key.
- `PrivateKey`: Private key for authentication.
- `Region`: OCI region of the storage.
- `BucketName`: Target bucket in Oracle Object Storage.
- `NamespaceName`: Namespace of the Oracle Object Storage.
- `GatewayUrl` (optional): Custom endpoint for network routing (optional).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio (or another .NET-compatible IDE).
3. Restore dependencies to ensure the `OCI.DotNetSDK.Objectstorage` library is available.

## Configuration

Update the `OracleStorageConfig` file or enter details in the application’s settings to configure your OCI credentials.

Example configuration structure:
```json
{
  "TenantId": "<Your-Tenant-Id>",
  "UserId": "<Your-User-Id>",
  "Fingerprint": "<Your-Fingerprint>",
  "PrivateKey": "<Your-Private-Key>",
  "Region": "<Your-Region>",
  "BucketName": "<Your-Bucket-Name>",
  "NamespaceName": "<Your-Namespace-Name>",
  "GatewayUrl": "<Your-Gateway-Url-Optional>"
}
```

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Run the application, which will open the main window interface.
2. **Configure OCI Settings**: Go to settings and enter your Oracle Object Storage credentials.
3. **File Operations**:
   - **Upload**: Select a file from your local system to upload to Oracle Object Storage.
   - **Download**: Select a file in Oracle Object Storage to download to your local system.
   - **Manage Files**: Use the interface to browse and manage files within your storage buckets.

### Use Cases

#### 1. Data Management for Cloud Storage
   - Provides a GUI to manage files in Oracle Object Storage without needing the command line.
   - Ideal for managing backups, documents, or media files in the cloud.

#### 2. Development and Testing
   - Simplifies testing of storage integrations and deployment assets.
   - Useful for uploading and managing configuration files and other assets during iterative development cycles.

#### 3. Data Transfer Utility
   - Acts as a data migration tool for transferring files between on-premises and Oracle cloud storage.
   - Streamlines data transfer for companies adopting cloud storage or needing disaster recovery solutions.
